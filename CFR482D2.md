A
------------------

This problem is trivial.
You only have to output N+1 when (N+1)%2 == 1 otherwise output (N+1)/2
but one detail worth notice: when N == 0, the answer is 0. I was hacked on the contest and so did I hack some other guys with this point. XD

B
------------------

I failed system test with this problem. The algorithm is greedy. We consider keep any type of character called special, and we try to transform most characters to the special character. I thought when left odd number of chances to transform, one can't reach the special character. But actually it can. Because we can transform it into another character then transform back.

C
------------------

It's a simple problem and the simplest way of solving it is to calculate the complementary set of the answer. Just calculate the number of ways which goes through F first then goes through B.

D
------------------

This problem should be easy but I had a calculation fault which causes my program time limit exceed.
I maintained a Trie with binary code of elements in array a. On each node I maintained a set of numbers which can divide any numbers represented by the sub-tree. I thought it's an O(N log^2 N) algorithm. But actually it's O(N log^3 N) because I ignored the time cost on std::set.
In the proper method, we tear the set apart. we build N Tries and each Trie represents all its multiple. Then it shorten the time to check if the numbers are dividable.

E
------------------

The problem can be solved with a simple dynamic programming. Notice that the arrows begin at a piece of paper whose number is smaller than that where it ends. Also notice that whether the count of ways is odd or even is decided by the sum of the ways ends in every piece of paper. And ways ends in one piece of paper is decided by ways it link the smaller ones and their parity. 

Assume that $f[i][ob][ow]$ means the count of ways for first $i$ papers, $ob$ of the black paper end with ways count of odd, $ow$ of the white paper end with ways count of odd. 

Suppose present paper is painted as white. We have the equations below:

$$
f(i+1,ow+1,ob)  += f(i,ow,ob)\times 2^{i-ob}\times \binom{ob}{e}\\
f(i+1,ow,ob)  += f(i,ow,ob)\times 2^{i-ob}\times \binom{ob}{o}\\
$$

notice that $\binom{n}{e} = \sum_{i=0} \binom{n}{i\times 2}$ and $\binom{n}{o} = \sum_{i=0} \binom{n}{i\times 2 +1}$

The situation which paper is painted as black is similar.

I didn't try solve the problem because time is not enough.

summary
------------------

When solving trivial details. I did really slow. So practice thinking about the details in limited time.
